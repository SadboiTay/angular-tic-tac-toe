This project is a personal first time entry into Angular and TypeScript and was built using a tutorial from Fireship.io

## Development Notes
Several things I learned/was exposed to in this project:
* TypeScript decorators - some sort of special declaration that can be attached to methods, accessors (getters/setters), properties, class declarations or parameters.

* The Angular CLI - this seems powerful and has some features that React didn't offer me, like creating components from the command line.

* Code Structure - different from React, which houses your JS logic and JSX for your component in a single file, Angular components are broken down into several different files containing your TS data logic and your HTML, which can be bound together using directives.

* Directives - a new concept to me. These are classes that add additional behavior to your elements in Angular apps (which I believe is where you can call upon your TS event logic that you've written for your component).

* Router - Angular provides a router to connect your 'pages' to a url address via client-side routing out of the box, which is cool.

* Styles - Similar to React, you can locally scope your CSS styling for each component so that they don't bleed out into other elements in your app.
